__Note__: This package isn't actually meant to be "serious". I made it just for teaching purposes.

This package is intended to be a learning exercise for building and modifying packages in `R`. 

```{r}
library(powers)
```

This package's `boxcox` function performs a Box-Cox transform. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
lambda = 2
boxcox(x, lambda)
```

It comes built-in with a plotting option too (disabled by default): 

```{r}
x = 1:10
lambda = 2
boxcox(x, lambda, plot=TRUE)
```
